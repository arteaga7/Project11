This repository presents a sales funnel analysis of a company.

The results of the A/A and A/B tests are analyzed using the proportions test and the Mann-Whitney U test to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the samples and their proportions, considering outliers and non-normal distributions. Finally, general conclusions are given.
